                This chicken biryani recipe features succulent, juicy pieces of chicken that are cooked in a yogurt
                marinade and then layered with crispy onions, coriander, mint and basmati rice to give you a dish that
                the entire family will enjoy. Iâ€™ve broken the process step by step and made a recipe video for this
                chicken biryani so that you can make this restaurant style biryani at home!

                Hyderabadi Biryani is said to be more spicy and savoury. It is made in the form of Dum and has a lot of
                Zaffron. Combining basmati rice and chicken makes Hyderabadi biryani distinguishable from others. The
                presentation and the pungent spices are the hallmarks of Hyderabadi Biryani
            </p>

            <p>
                I have made so many types of biryani, but dum biryani has the real taste. Love pressure cooker biryani
                and one pot biryani as well but nothing can beat a dum biryani when it is properly made.

                The cool part in making dum biryani is, when you are placing the biryani for dum, your house will be
                smelling like heaven. And also when you open the biryani it is just heaven. Can't describe it in words.

                Though Hyderabadi Biryani has been introduced by the Nizams, Andhras have added their own spices and
                made it even tastier. Biryani should be cooked on the wood fire, and only then it is authentic say
                Biryani Masters. But now that we do not use wood fire much, we could still get the same taste cooking on
                a gas stove.

                When I learned how to make Biryani, it was a big challenge for me to make small quantities, just for 4
                -5 people. I tried many times, reduced the spices and made it. But still, there was a problem in Dum, or
                it was too hard, or there was burnt crust at the bottom. But every time, I had the satisfaction that I
                learned something new. So this recipe is based on a lot of experience. And I have a detailed explanation
                on what could go wrong and what to do.

            <ul>
                <h3>What kind of Rice to use?:</h3>
                <li>
                    Sona Masuri can also be washed and soaked for an hour. But it needs a little bit more Dum. And more
                    Water should be added for the Dum.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <h3>Can we use Sona Masuri?</h3>
                <li>
                    Sona Masuri can also be washed and soaked for an hour. But it needs a little bit more Dum. And more
                    Water should be added for the Dum.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <h3>
                    Can we increase the measures to double to make double the quantity?
                </h3>
                <li>
                    More or less, yes. But whenever I make double, I add only 1.3/4. That is Salt or Mirchi that I add
                    for a cup of Rice is increased to 1.3/4 cup or spoons only while cooking double. How much ever
                    technology we may have, I bet that it cannot precisely determine the taste each human being likes. I
                    have given my regular ingredients. But it is always better for you to taste and decide on your
                    measurements.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <h3>
                    Why is the Chicken rubbery with no Masala sticking to it?
                </h3>
                <li>
                    Chicken should always be less than a kilo. An older, bigger Chicken does not cook well.

                    If the Chicken has to soak in all the flavours, then it has to be marinated in a fridge overnight
                    and then it is tender after Dum.

                    I have used tissues for this Biryani Dum. You could use Banana Leaves or a leaf plate.

                    You should have equal parts of Rice and Chicken for Chicken Biryani. Whatever the measure I took, I
                    added double the Chicken.

                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <h3>
                    Finally, some tips to make the Biryani tastier:
                </h3>
                <li>
                    I have used Fried Onions as I had some. If you fry Onions in Oil and then use that Oil in the
                    Biryani, the Biryani will get a nice aroma.

                    Chicken Biryani tastes better with more Ghee.

                    If you add Lemon Juice to Rice while it is boiling, then the Rice stays white.

                    The Rice should be added only when the Water is boiling, or Rice becomes sticky, and the grains are
                    not fluffy.

                    Salt should be more in Biryani. If you taste the Water, it should taste like seawater. It is only
                    the Salt that you add to boiling water that gets into the Biryani. The Salt does not stick even if
                    you add later to the Biryani. So you must check Salt while the Rice is added to the boiling Water.
